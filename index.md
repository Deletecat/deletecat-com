## Hello

I am Deletecat; welcome to my website! There's not much for me to say besides that I like cats (obvs!!), computers and coding.

I'm not the fastest at completing projects. Most of the time I will get started on one and then move to the next fairly quickly. But any I do complete, I'll be sure to write about them here and share their code on my Git server.

Most of my work is on [flashcarts.net](https://github.com/flashcarts) projects. Go check them out!

### Git repository locations

I mirror my projects across several locations. Here's a list:

+ Self-hosted [soft-serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve): `ssh://git@git.deletecat.com:23231`
	+ Run `ssh git.deletecat.com -p 23231` in your terminal to browse the repositories on this server.
	+ Only the Git and SSH protocols have been configured, HTTP is not available.
+ GitHub: <https://github.com/Deletecat>
+ Codeberg: <https://codeberg.org/Deletecat>

These mirrors may appear or disappear at any time. The only repository available at the moment is the source to my website.
